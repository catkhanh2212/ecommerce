    name: "Type 2 Diabetes and Sleep: What’s the Connection?",
    date: "11/11/2024",
    intro: "If you have type 2 diabetes, you probably pay attention to what you eat and try to stay physically active. But there is another important component of managing your condition that you may not always prioritize: sleep. \n You may have heard that making sure you get good sleep is an important part of staying healthy, particularly if you have type 2 diabetes. But what exactly is the connection between diabetes and sleep, does diabetes cause insomnia, and why should sleep be considered a crucial pillar in managing the condition? Here’s what you need to know.",
    title1: "Sleep and Insulin Resistance",
    para1: "“Sleep is a time for your body to rest and repair, but a lot of things happen as you move through the sleep stages throughout the night,” says Josie Bidwell, DNP, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi Medical Center School of Medicine in Jackson. During sleep, says Dr. Bidwell, your brain stores memories, your muscles are repaired, your heart rate goes down, and your blood pressure falls. Lower resting heart rate and blood pressure are particularly important if you have type 2 diabetes, since having the condition makes you twice as likely to be diagnosed with heart disease.[1] \n Getting at least seven hours of sleep is the sweet spot for most people.[2] In a study on adults who had prediabetes or were recently diagnosed with — but untreated for — type 2 diabetes, sleeping fewer than five hours or longer than eight hours per night was associated with a higher A1C level compared with those who got a more moderate amount of sleep. Sleeping fewer than six hours per night was also associated with a higher body mass index (BMI), which increases the risk for type 2 diabetes and makes blood sugar levels harder to control. \n While it’s not clearly understood why sleeping longer may be detrimental to your health, there are many potential hormonal changes that occur with sleep loss. “There is a biochemical cascade driven by inflammatory substances, such as cytokines, after sleep loss that can set someone up for insulin resistance,” notes Bidwell. What’s more, as the aforementioned research points out, sleep deprivation activates your sympathetic nervous system, responsible for your fight-or-flight stress response, which can also decrease insulin sensitivity. This is an area of ongoing research.",

    title2: "How Uncontrolled Blood Sugar Can Disrupt Sleep",
    para2: "Along with physiological changes, sleep deprivation also prompts people to consume more calories and decreases their ability to make nutritious choices and maintain a healthy lifestyle. This can lead to increased risk for diabetes and obesity, which itself is a risk factor for diabetes, research has suggested.\n And the relationship between sleep and blood sugar levels goes the other way, too. “When blood sugar runs higher [than normal], you urinate more often,” says Bidwell. In other words, extra blood sugar goes into the urine and pulls water from your tissues, so you pee more. You may find that you’re waking up multiple times per night to go to the bathroom, which can disrupt sleep. It’s also important to point out that if your blood sugar dips too low (below 70 mg/dL) in your sleep — a condition called nocturnal hypoglycemia — you may also experience restless sleep, have nightmares, and sweat in your sleep.",
    title3: "The Link Between Sleep Apnea and Type 2 Diabetes",
    para3: "The relationship between type 2 diabetes and OSA is complex. First, obesity is a major risk factor for both conditions. Second, OSA may lead to increases in blood glucose due to increases in stress hormones. Third, type 2 diabetes may worsen OSA via damage to nerves involved in respiration. \n The first-line treatment for OSA is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, which involves sleeping while breathing air through a mask at increased pressure. For adults who also have obesity, the weight-loss drug tirzepatide (Zepbound) is approved to treat moderate-to-severe OSA. Despite these options, many people with type 2 diabetes do not receive adequate treatment for OSA."

    title1: "Does Over-the-Counter Cold Medicine Alleviate Symptoms of a Cold or the Flu?",
    para1: "“Over-the-counter (OTC) pain and fever reducers or decongestants can lessen cold and flu symptoms, but they will not cure the underlying viral infection, according to the Cleveland Clinic. Nor can antibiotics, which are only effective against bacterial infections. \nThe following are some of the many nonprescription products available to ease cold and flu symptoms. \n",
    para1subtitle1: "Analgesics (for Pain and Fever)",
    para1subpara1: "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is a top choice. Other popular options are ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).\n Be cautious about taking too much acetaminophen, as this can damage the liver. The daily dose should not exceed 4 grams (g) per day, and for people with liver issues, 2 g per day.",
    para1subtitle2: "Antihistamines",
    para1subpara2: "Diphenhydramine (Benadryl, Sominex) can offer relief for a runny nose, but it can also make you sleepy. Loratadine (Alavert, Claritin) won’t make you drowsy, but it may not be as effective. Other OTC choices include fexofenadine (Allegra), cetirizine (Alleroff, Zyrtec), and levocetirizine (Xyzal).",
    para1subtitle3: 'Decongestants',
    para1subpara3: 'OTC medications such as pseudoephedrine (Silfedrine, Sudafed) can help with a stuffy nose, but for some people, side effects of pseudoephedrine can include nervousness, insomnia, and irritability. People with uncontrolled high blood pressure should avoid pseudoephedrine, advises the Mayo Clinic.',
    title2: "Is There Medication for the Flu?",
    para2: 'The CDC recommends prompt medical attention for people who get the flu and are at high risk of developing complications, such as adults who are 65 and older, pregnant women, and people with chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease, HIV, and cancer. People taking immunosuppressive medications are also at a higher risk for flu complications.',
    title3: "What Treatment Options Are Safe During Pregnancy?",
    para3: 'According to the Cleveland Clinic, natural remedies like saline nasal drops and warm saltwater gargling are ideal cold and flu treatments during pregnancy.\n Vicks VapoRub and cough drops (with the exception of sugar-free cough drops for gestational diabetes that contain blends of herbs or aspartame) are also considered safe during pregnancy.\n Women who are pregnant or trying to get pregnant should check with their healthcare provider before taking any drug. While no medication can be considered 100 percent safe for pregnant women, the Cleveland Clinic lists the following as among those generally considered to be okay.'

    title1: "Manage Hypertension With a Healthy Diet",
    para1: "“An important part of a high blood pressure treatment plan is to stick to a healthy diet, including limiting sodium intake. The U.S. government’s 2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend consuming less than 2,300 milligrams (mg) of sodium per day. (2) People with high blood pressure may need to restrict sodium intake even more. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for adults with hypertension. (3). \n\n It’s important to pay attention to food labels and choose options that are low-sodium and “no salt added” at the grocery store and while cooking. (4) \n\n Your doctor may recommend the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, which focuses on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, as well as fat-free or low-fat dairy products, fish, poultry, beans, nuts, and vegetable oils. The DASH plan also limits foods high in saturated fats, including fatty meats, full-fat dairy products, and tropical oils, like coconut and palm oils, as well as sugary drinks and other sweets. (5) \n\n A 2017 study of more than 400 adults with stage 1 high blood pressure found that combining a low-salt diet with the DASH eating plan was as effective as certain drugs in lowering systolic blood pressure.

Migraine attacks and cluster headaches feel and act differently, according to Dr. Diamond. \n\n People with a migraine attack may experience nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, while those with a cluster headache experience watery eyes and a runny nose, she says. \n\n By contrast, cluster headaches occur suddenly, almost always cause symptoms on one side of the head, and are accompanied by a runny nose and tearing eye on the same side of the head as the headache. For this reason, cluster headaches are often confused with sinus headaches, Diamond says, though their pain is distinct.",
